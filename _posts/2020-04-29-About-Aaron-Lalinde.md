Well. Finally got around to putting a website together. My goal for this website is to be able to put structure to everything I learned
as I pursue my Masters in Computer Science with a focus on Information Assurance and Cyber-security. I will also put any side projects I have done in order to improve my skillsets. I will use this website to interact with anyone who is also on the same boat and wants to discuss topics from our classes or anyone just curious on the subject. I welcome anyone to share their knowledge with me. Like I said I am no expert nor am I currently a professional in the field. If there is anyone willing to mentor I am very open minded and welcome the idesa with open arms. I also realized by having a website it will allow me to stay disciplined and motivated. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Adios! -Aaron Lalinde
